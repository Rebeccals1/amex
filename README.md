# 🌟 American Express: Attentive Recommendation

Welcome to the **Attentive Recommendation Engine** repository, developed during the Break Through Tech AI program! 🚀 This project showcases an advanced recommendation system using a two-tower model with attention mechanisms to deliver relevant and accurate recommendations across various applications. 💡

## Project Overview 📚

Our goal is to build a robust recommendation system leveraging a **two-tower architecture** integrated with **attention mechanisms**. This approach helps capture user-item interactions effectively, boosting the relevance and quality of recommendations. 🔍✨

## Business Context 💼

This recommendation engine is designed to support various applications within the **financial services** industry, particularly enhancing customer experiences for organizations like **American Express**. By integrating advanced recommendation techniques, companies can:

- **Improve Customer Engagement** 📈: Personalize offers and recommendations, leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention.
- **Boost Revenue** 💰: Optimize product and service suggestions to drive up-selling and cross-selling opportunities.
- **Enhance Operational Efficiency** ⚙️: Automate the personalization process, reducing manual effort and increasing scalability.

## 📂 Datasets

This project uses publicly available datasets, including:

- **User interaction data**: Tracks user behavior and interactions.
- **Item metadata**: Contains detailed information about recommended items.
- **Contextual data**: Provides enriching contextual information for recommendations.

These datasets form the backbone of our training and evaluation process. 📊

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing ensures the model's accuracy and reliability:

1. **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **EDA**: Explore data distributions, identify trends, and inform feature engineering. 🔍📈

## 🧩 Model Development

Our **two-tower model** architecture is designed as follows:

- **User Tower** 🧑: Processes user features to generate embeddings.
- **Item Tower** 📦: Processes item features to generate embeddings.

### ✨ Attention Mechanism
An attention mechanism assigns importance weights to different features, allowing the model to capture complex user-item interactions more effectively. 🌟

## 📈 Results and Evaluation

We assess model performance using the following metrics:

- **Loss** 📉: Evaluates the model's error during training and testing.
- **Precision** 🔧: Measures the proportion of true positive recommendations.
- **Accuracy** ✅: Indicates the overall correctness of the model's predictions.

Baseline comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

## 👥 Contributors
A huge shoutout to the amazing team behind this project! 🙌
